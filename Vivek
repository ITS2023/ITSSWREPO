Dear [CEO's Name],

I am writing this email to request a three-day leave from work, starting from [start date] to [end date]. As a trainee junior software engineer at Iclonis tech solutions Bengaluru, I have always been committed to my work and have strived to deliver the best outcomes.

However, I have recently received my exam results, and I am not satisfied with my performance. Therefore, I have decided to apply for paper revaluation, which requires me to visit my college and complete the necessary formalities.

I understand the importance of my work and the impact my absence may have on my team's productivity. Therefore, I will ensure that all my pending tasks are completed and handed over to my team lead before I leave. I will also be available on call or email in case of any emergency or clarification required.

I assure you that I will complete all my pending work as soon as I return to work and ensure that there is no delay or impact on our project timelines.

I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. Please let me know if there is any further information or documentation required from my end.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Vivek Naik

Trainee Junior Software Engineer

Iclonis Tech Solutions, Bengaluru
